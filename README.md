# Displace
Quickly change display resolutions from the menu bar on macOS 12.0 or newer.

This project is work-in-progress!

## Goals

With this app I primarily want to try out some specific approaches:

- A menu bar app with a separate settings app
- An app group for sharing user defaults
- Global shortcuts that can be set in the preferences and applied in the menu bar app
